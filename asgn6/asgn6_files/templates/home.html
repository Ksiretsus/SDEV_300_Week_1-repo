    <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Based on the 1995 movie of the same name, Goldeneye is a first-person shooter
            that was launched in 1997. Origianlly planned to be released on the
            Super Nintendo, the finalized Goldeneye 64 product was wildly different from its
            initial pitch to Nintendo as a 2D platformer. The production studio Rareware
            gave the development team a huge swathe of creative freedom and the project 
            evolved from a 2D platformer, to an on-rails shooter like Virtua Cop, and
            then to its final state as THE game that dragged first-person shooters from the
            smaller Doom, Quake, and Wolfenstein community and into the mainstream.
        </p>
        <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>The working vision of the team was to create a game that allowed players
                more freedom of movement, and more interaction with the environment than
                the previous genreation of shooters. They came up with many new ideas
                that hadn't been implemented before on consoles such as:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gun reloading</li>
                    <li>Position dependent hits on enemies</li>
                    <li>Bullet marks on walls</li>
                    <li>Cartridge case ejections</li>
                </ol>
                <p>and level design that had a lot of emphasis on interesting spaces, with
                some areas having no relevance to a level other than that of a place to
                explore.

                Probably the most important release feature of the game was its
                multiplayer mode. Multiplayer was completely unplanned, yet it was
                added just four months before the games release. Programmer Steve
                Ellies sat in his office and created most of the multiplayer mode,
                while other team members assisted after hours with Rareware and
                Nintendo not being aware of this side project until just before release.
                It turned out to be the part of the project that kept Goldeneye in the
                top 10 or 20 lists even today, 25 years after its release.

    <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>
                Goldeney brought the first-person shooter genre to the console market.
                Before that, FPS style games were limited to desktop computers and were
                largely single player. One of its biggest impacts was that of multiplayer.
                While many desktop shooters of the time had multiplayer modes, it tended
                to be cumbersome and needed at least two computers, networking equpment,
                two monitors, and the space for it all. In contrast the equipment for a four
                player Goldeneye match could be carried by one person. Goldeneye also 
                brought the genre out of the 'Shoot everything' gameplay style of Doom and
                Quake, by introducing stealth and noise radius which rewarded players for
                being clever and avoiding guards. A final lasting feature of the game is 
                the zoomable sniper rifle, which had not bee seen before but is now ubiquitous
                in the FPS genre.
            </p>
    <h2>Continuing Legacy:</h2>
        <h3>Speedrunning</h3>
            <p>Goldeneye caught the interest of the speedrunning community due to the
                inclusion of an in game level timer. The speedrunning community is
                large and has gotten bigger proportionally to the interent. While most
                play the game as designed, speedrunners thrive on finding exploits
                that allow them to shave time off of levels with some being completed in
                unde rone minute.
            </p>
        <h3>Mod/Hack Community</h3>
            <p>The modding community creates tools that they use to modify the Goldeneye
                game code in order to create new multiplayer rule sets, modify single player
                difficulty settings, change AI behavior, and even create new full length
                games based on other James Bond movies, but using the Goldeneye game engine.
